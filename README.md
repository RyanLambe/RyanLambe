# Hello, I am Ryan Lambe!

I'm a Computer Science student at Western University. 
I have recently been working on some low-level projects, such as [RL OS](https://github.com/RyanLambe/RL-OS), [Zig2D](https://github.com/RyanLambe/Zig2D), and [RL Engine](https://github.com/RyanLambe/RL-Engine).

### My current project is [RL-OS](https://github.com/RyanLambe/RL-OS) so be sure to check it out!

#### I also have a portfolio website you can check out: [rlambe.dev](https://rlambe.dev/)

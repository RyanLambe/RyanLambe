### I am currently working on [RL Engine V2](https://github.com/RyanLambe/RL-Engine) and [ET-Remake](https://github.com/RyanLambe/ET-Remake) so be sure to check them out!

Highly proficient and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate (April 2025), seeking meaningful opportunities to collaborate on projects that push myself to learn and develop my skills. 

I have been mainly focused on low-level programming and have developed several personal projects, such as Game Engines and an Operating System while prioritizing Data-Oriented Design.
